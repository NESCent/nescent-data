NESCent Data
============

This repository is for public data obtained for, about, and from NESCent activities.

Initially this will be primarily data about Informatics products, resources, and activities, but the scope is not limited to Informatics.

Why host the data on Github, and not in an online data archive?
-----------------

There are several reasons.

* Most of the data here will not have been used in a publication (yet), and may not even have been analyzed. Hence, their value and usefulness is undetermined, and thus whether archival in perpetuity is even desirable.
* Many of the data will be of a longitudinal nature, such as impact metrics for our Informatics products, and thus stand to be updated in the future. Version control is well suited to document such updates.
* Some (many?) of the data may contain errors, may be incomplete, or could be better structured. Distributed version control and Github's social coding features enable the community at large to contribute to addressing such problems in a collaborative manner.
* In a similar manner, this makes it straightforward to put analysis and visualization scripts and their results right next to the data, and also allows the community at large to contribute to these.

Contributions welcome
---------------------

As outlined above, contributions to this repository by the community at large are encouraged. Contributions can take a variety of forms, from fixes to the data, to improving their structure or format, to analysis and visualization results. Simply fork the repository and submit your changes through a pull request.

Also, if you encounter issues with the data, [please file an issue in the tracker](https://github.com/NESCent/nescent-data/issues).

### Citing by (commit) version instead of by date

Instead of using the date, you can also refer to the exact version of a file by the SHA1 of the corresponding commit. Abbreviated forms of the SHA1 work as well, see for example [the initial version of this file](https://github.com/NESCent/nescent-data/blob/78f4ff/README.md). If you are unfamiliar with how to obtain the commit for the desired version of a file, use the Github user-interface to find the file, then click on "History" and choose the desired version by commit (such as the latest).
